# hello-world
just a test...I'm curious to see what happens. I mean whats the worst that couldn't happen?
Anywho, me i'm a nice person, kind, with a slight dash of anger management issues that originated from daily encounters with terrible drivers. Its not to say i am particularly a good driver though.
